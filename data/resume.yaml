          Hi, I'm Cody, a software developer with a commitment to efficiency
          and excellence. I'm passionate about enhancing productivity through
          platform engineering, refactoring to reduce complexity, or any other
          challenge offered by a full-stack role.

          Rather than simply addressing immediate challenges, I take pride in
          solving entire classes of problems, seeking to understand their root
          causes and addressing them holistically.

          My toolbox includes `Git`, `React-Native`, `TypeScript`, `Golang`,
          `Vue`, `Hugo`, `CircleCI`, `GitHub Actions`, `Fastlane`, `MySQL`,
          `MongoDB`, `Docker`, `Auth0`, and Stripe. I'm also eagerly exploring
          `Rust` and `WebAssembly` as a possible front-end replacement for
          `TypeScript`.

          *I am more than a programmer; I am a problem solver. These tools are
          not my limits, they are my foundation.*
