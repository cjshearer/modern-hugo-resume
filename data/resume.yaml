          Hi, I'm Cody, a software developer with a commitment to efficiency
          and excellence. I'm passionate about enhancing productivity through
          platform engineering, refactoring to reduce complexity, or any other
          challenge offered by a full-stack role.


          Rather than simply addressing immediate challenges, I take pride in
          solving entire classes of problems, seeking to understand their root
          causes and addressing them holistically.


          My toolbox includes `Git, React-Native, TypeScript, Golang, Vue,
          Hugo, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, Fastlane, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker,
          Auth0, `and` Stripe`. I'm also eagerly exploring `Rust` and
          `WebAssembly` as a possible front-end replacement for TypeScript.


          *I am more than a programmer; I am a problem solver. These tools are
          not my limits, they are my foundation.*
