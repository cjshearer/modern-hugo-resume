#       A scan-and-go webapp to streamline customers' shopping experiences
#       and automate a business's inventory tracking.
#     description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
#       My role in this project is to develop a single page application for
#       customers to scan and pay for items in their shopping cart. To simplify
#       collaboration for our team with little front-end experience, I selected
#       Vue as a framework for its component-based architecture and the Vuetify
#       Library to enforce a consistent UI design.
#       My biggest takeaway from this project is the importance of consistent
#       communication and being open to change. In a team of five, there are five
#       different visions of the final product, so it's important to amicably
#       resolve these differences as early in the design process as possible.
