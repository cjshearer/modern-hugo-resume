# Changes from source:
# - remove URLs instead of altering them
# - added replacement to remove italics, modifying the "bold" replacement to
#   accommodate this method
# - removed 'heading', 'js script', 'tweet group', and 'add newline'

# Configure regular expressions for custom article text output.
# Arguments for replaceRE, applied iteratively to .RawContent.
# Patterns with backslashes must be encapsulated within single quotes.
# Use single backslashes to escape characters. Do not use double backslashes.
# Set skip = true to skip a particular replacement.
