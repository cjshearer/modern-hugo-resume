#     My role in this project is to develop a single page application for
#     customers to scan and pay for items in their shopping cart. To simplify
#     collaboration for our team with little front-end experience, I selected
#     Vue as a framework for its component-based architecture and the Vuetify
#     Library to enforce a consistent UI design.

#     My biggest takeaway from this project is the importance of consistent
#     communication and being open to change. In a team of five, there are five
#     different visions of the final product, so it's important to amicably
#     resolve these differences as early in the design process as possible.
