    A scan-and-go webapp to streamline customers' shopping experiences
    and automate a business's inventory tracking.

    My role in this project is to develop a single page application for
    customers to scan and pay for items in their shopping cart. To simplify
    collaboration for our team with little front-end experience, I selected
    Vue as a framework for its component-based architecture and the Vuetify
    Library to enforce a consistent UI design.

    My biggest takeaway from this project is the importance of consistent
    communication and being open to change. In a team of five, there are five
    different visions of the final product, so it's important to amicably
    resolve these differences as early in the design process as possible.
