## About Me

{{<resume/entry>}}

Hi, I'm Cody, a software developer with a commitment to efficiency and excellence. I'm passionate about enhancing productivity through platform engineering, refactoring to reduce complexity, or any other challenge offered by a full-stack role.

Rather than simply addressing immediate challenges, I take pride in solving entire classes of problems, seeking to understand their root causes and addressing them holistically.

My toolbox includes `Git`, `React-Native`, `TypeScript`, `Golang`, `Vue`, `Hugo`, `CircleCI`, `GitHub Actions`, `Fastlane`, `MySQL`, `MongoDB`, `Docker`, `Auth0`, and Stripe. I'm also eagerly exploring `Rust` and `WebAssembly` as a possible front-end replacement for `TypeScript`.

_I am more than a programmer; I am a problem solver. These tools are not my limits, they are my foundation._
